//[abstract]
The menagerie of beasts and artefacts depicted in RFC8140
may be usefully supplemented by other renowned figures of
Internet and more general lore. This document extends the
menagerie to the seminal fable of the
"Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch", as depicted in the
Monty Python film "Monty Python and the Holy Grail",
as well as "Spamalot", the musical inspired by the movie.

[NOTE,remove-in-rfc=false]
.Spamalot
The relevance of the musical "Spamalot" to Internet lore should be
obvious to the reader; but in case of doubt, see also
Section 1 ("What is Spam*?") of <<RFC2635>>.

The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",

== Introduction

<<RFC8140>> refers to the intended move of RFC formatting to
XML2RFC v3 <<RFC7990>>, in the following terms:

[quote,attribution="A. Farrel"]
____
Although the RFC Editor has recently dragged the IETF kicking and
screaming into the twentieth century [RFC7990] [RFC7996], there is a
yearning among all right-thinking Internet architects to "keep it
simple" and to return to the olden days when pigs could be given
thrust without anyone taking undue offence.

While no pigs, flying or otherwise, are involved in the transition
to RFC XML v3, it is opportune to enhance the <<RFC8140>>
legendarium in the service of RFC XML v3, by illustrating its
functionality through references to the mythology of Camelot, and
particularly the incidents at the Cave of Caerbannog.

The screaming move into the twenty-*first* century is accompanied by
a move back to the late twentieth century, with ASCII stylings more
wonted in haunts like \ftp://ftp.wwa.com/pub/Scarecrow (known to be
accessible in 1996.)

There are two references to rabbits in
_Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ which are expounded on herewith:

////

// tag::listcontinuation[]

Trojan Rabbit::
In their siege of the French-occupied castle which may already
contain an instance of the Grail, Sir Bedevere the Wise proposes to
use a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate the castle, with a raiding party
to take the French "not only by surprise, but totally unarmed."
+
The proposal, unsurprisingly, proved abortive. The more so as the
raiding party forgot to hide within the Trojan Rabbit, before the
French soldiers took the Trojan Rabbit inside the castle.

Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog::
Guarding the entrance to the Cave of Caerbannog; see <<caerbannog>>.

The participants of that renowned exercise in cross-cultural
communication, to wit the exchange between the
_Knights of the Round Table_
and the taunting French soldiers serving under *Guy de Lombard* are,
properly speaking, outside the scope of this `menagerie`, being more
or less human. Notwithstanding, several^ish^ beasts both animate~d~
and wooden played a significant part in this encounter; most
notably:

* The Projectile Cow, see <<projectile-cow>>
* The Trojan Rabbit, see <<trojan-rabbit>>

****
While the exchange at the French-occupied castle is one of
the more memorable scenes of _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_,
the Trojan Rabbit has not reached the same level of cultural
resonance as its more murderous counterpart. Reasons for this
may include:

* Less overall screen-time dedicated to the Trojan Rabbit.

* The Trojan Rabbit as projectile has already been anticipated
by the Cow as projectile.

The exchange of projectile animals was the beginning of a
long-running fruitful relationship between the British and the
French peoples, which
arguably predates the traditional English enmity with the
French.

TODO: Will need to verify that claim.

Strictly speaking, the Knights are Welsh.

[[caerbannog]]
== The Mythos of Caerbannog

////
[.comment]
tag::xref1[]
// tag::xref[]
////

The _Cave of Caerbannog_ has been well-established in the mythology
of Camelot (as recounted by Monty Python) as the lair of the
Legendary Black Beast of Arrrghhh, more commonly known today as the
*Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog* <<killer_rabbit_caerbannog>>.
It is the encounter between the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog and the
Knights of the Round Table, armed with the Holy Hand Grenade of
Antioch (see the <<holy_hand_grenade,following section>>), that we
recount here through monospace font and multiple spaces.

The *Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog*, that most formidable foe of
the Knights and of all that is holy or carrot-like, has been
depicted diversely in lay and in song. We venture to say,
_contra_ the claim made in <<RFC8140,of,section=4.1>>,
that the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog truly is the most afeared
of all the creatures. Short of sanctified ordnance such as
<<holy_hand_grenade,format=title>>, there are few remedies
known against its awful lapine powers.

The solution to the impasse at the ((Cave of Caerbannog)) was
provided by the successful deployment of the
*Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch* (see <<hand-grenade-figure>>)
(((Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch))).
Any similarity between the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch and the
mythical _Holy Spear of Antioch_ is purely intentional;
(((relics, Christian))) any similarity between the Holy Hand Grenade
of Antioch and the _Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom_
(see <<sovereign-orb>>) is putatively fortuitous.

Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch::
  Ordnance deployed by Brother Maynard under the incantation of a
  lector, in order to dispense with the Foes of the Virtuous.
  See <<hand-grenade-figure>>.

Holy Spear of Antioch::
  A supposed relic of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, this is one
  of at least four claimed instances of the lance that pierced
  Christ's side. Its historical significance lies in inspiring
  crusaders to continue their siege of Antioch in 1098.

Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom::
  Part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, the Sovereign's
  Orb is a hollow gold sphere set with jewels and topped with a
  cross.  It was made for Charles II in 1661. See <<sovereign-orb>>.

=== Past the Killer Rabbit

Once the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog (<<killer-bunny>>) had been

[quote, Joseph of Arimathea, https://context.reverso.net]
____
&#x2e;כאן אולי ימצאו המילים האחרונות של יוסף מארמתיה
&#x2e;מי אשר יהיה אמיץ ובעל נפש טהורה יוכל למצוא את הגביע הקדוש בטירת אאאאאאאה

"Here may be found the last words of Joseph&nbsp;of Arimathea.
He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail
in the castle of &mdash; Aaaargh."

Do not let the Killer Rabbit out under any circumstance.

I repeat. Do not let the Killer Rabbit (<<killer-bunny>>) out.
